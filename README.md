# Advent Of Code 2021
Welcome to my repository for Advent of Code 2021. I'm partaking this year and using this opportunity to learn more about Bash/Shell Scripting. I will be documenting my progress here as well as the things I have learned throughout the project.

## Things that I've learned:
---
### Day 1

- If having trouble with data types, you can declare the type of the variable with **declare** and using an option (i.e -i)
- If-statements use two different syntaxes, either [ *condition* ] **or** ((*condition*)). The square brackets method is based on the command **test** and uses the same operators. The double brackets is a light variation and can be used for more complex conditions.
- If you need to read from a file, you can use **while read** to effectively do so.
- To get the length of an array, you can use @ or * to call all elements and prefixing # to get the number of elements.
